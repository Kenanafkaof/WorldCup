Welcome to my **FIFA WORLD CUP PREDICTIONS**!

This project is divided into two separate directories. The model and the frontend/backend. The database classes and methods can all be found in the ``conversion.py`` file which is in ``model/module`` -- this file contains all the essential functions for the backend. 

In order to run this program, please run the **init.py** file which will create the db and insert the required tables. This is to make sure that you are able to see the fields as well as the background processes/work which went into the creation of this model and the frontend.

requirements.txt can be found here and should be installed prior to running!
