Welcome to my **FIFA WORLD CUP PREDICTIONS**!

This project is divided into two separate directories. The model and the frontend/backend. The database classes and methods can all be found in the ``conversion.py`` file which is in ``model/module`` -- this file contains all the essential functions for the backend. 

If you are using the integrated database and experience issues, then please remove it and run the init file which can be found within the same directory as this file (readme).

A test user account which can be used to login is: **username**: test | **password**: test

requirements.txt can be found here and should be installed!
